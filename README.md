A fully functional shopping cart built with **React**, showcasing API data fetching, dynamic state management, and responsive UI design.

## Features

- Browse products fetched from an external API (`https://fakestoreapi.com`)
- Add/remove products to/from a cart
- Adjust item quantities with `+`, `â€“`, or manual input
- Prevent invalid quantities and disable controls accordingly
- View your cart with live quantity updates in the navbar
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Styled with CSS modules and custom background image

## Technologies Used

- **React (v18+)**
- **React Router (v6+)**
- **CSS Modules** for scoped styling
- **useState**, **useEffect**, **useOutletContext** for state and context management
- **Vite** for fast dev server & build process

## What I Learned

- Component-based architecture
- React Router DOM setup with nested routes
- Data fetching with `fetch()` and `useEffect`
- Managing shared state via `useOutletContext`
- Controlled form inputs (`<input type="number">` with validation)
- Passing props and updating component state cleanly
